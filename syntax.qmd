## R and other code

R code is included in code chunks:

```{r cars}
#| echo: true
head(cars)
```

Similar chunks support other languages such as Python.
This template focuses on R but can be used with any other code language supported by Quarto.


## Figures

```{r}
#| label: fig-pressure
#| fig.cap: "Figure _title_ with maths : $\\pi$ and cross-reference to @tbl-kable"
plot(pressure)
```

Figures can be created by  R code (@fig-pressure).
A label is associated with each figure: its name is given in the `#| label:` option of the chunk that produces it.
It must start with `fig-`.
Cross-references are made with the command `@label`, e.g.: `@fig-pressure`.

Existing figures are integrated into a piece of code by the `include_graphics()` function, see @fig-logo.

```{r}
#| label: fig-logo
#| fig.cap: "Logo"
#| out.width: 30%
knitr::include_graphics("images/logo.png")
```

Systematically place these files in the `images` folder for the automation of GitHub pages.


## Tables

The horizontal `-` and vertical separators `|` allow you to draw a table according to Markdown syntax, but this is not the best method in R.

Tables can also be produced by R code.
The content of the table is in a dataframe.
The `kable()` function in the _knitr_ package prepares the table for display and passes the result to the `kable_styling` function in the _kableExtra_ package for final formatting.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-kable
#| tbl-cap: "Table _created_ by R, with $\\pi$. Not correctly formated as of Quarto v. 1.2."
#| echo: TRUE
#| tidy: false
#| warning: FALSE

library("tidyverse")
names(iris) <- c("Sepal length", "Width", "Petal length", 
                 "Width", "Species")
knitr::kable(
  head(iris), longtable = TRUE, booktabs = TRUE
) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```

The caption is specified by the `#| tbl-cap:` chunk option.
At the moment, it is restricted to simple text without format, math or cross references (@tbl-kable), in contrast with figure captions (see @fig-pressure).

Always use the `booktabs = TRUE` argument so that the separator lines are optimal in LaTeX.
The `bootstrap_options = "striped"` option provides more readable tables in HTML.

In LaTeX, `longtable = TRUE` selects the "longtable" package to format tables.
Such tables are placed in the text.
Due to limits of the "longtable" package which does not support multi-column layouts, the Stylish Article template uses a workaround that does not allow really long tables to be split into several columns or pages.
So, `longtable = TRUE` only means that the table will be one-column wide and located in the text if possible. 
If not, it will float.

To use the full width of the page, like @tbl-Paracou, `longtable` is set to `FALSE` and `table.envir = "table"` is added in the aguments of `kable()`.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-Paracou
#| tbl-cap: "Large table with maths, on two columns"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

Intervention <- data.frame(
  Treatment=c("Control", "T1", "T2", "T3"),
  Timber=c("", 
           "DBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, commercial species, $\\approx$ 10 trees/ha", 
           "DBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, commercial species, $\\approx$ 10 trees/ha",
           "DBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, commercial species, $\\approx$ 10 trees/ha"),
  Thinning=c("", 
             "", 
             "DBH $\\geq$ 40 cm, non-valuable species, $\\approx$ 30 trees/ha", 
             "DBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, non-valuable species, $\\approx$ 15 trees/ha  "),
  Fuelwood=c("", 
             "", 
             "", 
             "40 cm $\\leq$ DBH $\\leq$ 50 cm, non-valuable species, $\\approx$ 15 trees/ha"),
  AGBLost=c(0, "$[12\\%-33\\%]$", "$[33\\%-56\\%]$", "$[35\\%-56\\%]$")
)
names(Intervention)[5] <- "\\%AGB lost"
knitr::kable(Intervention, longtable = FALSE, table.envir = "table", booktabs = TRUE, escape = FALSE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

This table contains mathematics: the `escape = FALSE` argument is necessary in `kable()`.

Finally, the `full_width = TRUE` argument in `kable_styling()` adjusts the width of the table to the available width.
It must be set for correct formatting of two-column tables in LaTeX.

Note that tables can't be shown on the first page of the PDF output of the Stylish Article template: it would conflict with the table of contents.


## Lists

Lists are indicated by `*`, `+` and `-` (three hierarchical levels) or numbers `1.`, `i.` and `A.` (numbered lists).
Indentation of lists indicates their level: `*`, `+` and `-` may be replaced by `-` at all levels, but four spaces are needed to nest a list into another.

* First element of a list
    + sub-list
* Second element
* Continuation of the list

Leave an empty line before and after the list, but not between its items.


## Math

Equations in LaTeX format can be inserted inline, like $A=\pi r^2$ or isolated like $$e^{i \pi} = -1.$$

They can be numbered, see @eq-disk, after adding them a label:

$$
  A = \pi r^2.
$${#eq-disk}


## Cross-references

Figures and tables have a label declared in their code chunk option `tbl.cap` or `fig.cap`, starting with `fig-` or `tbl-`.

For equations, the label is added manually by the code `{#eq-xxx}` after the end of the equation.

Sections can be tagged by ending their title with `{#sec-yyy}`.

In all cases, the call to the reference is made by `@`.


## Bibliography

Bibliographic references included in the `.bib` file declared in the document header can be called by `[@CitationKey]`, in parentheses [@Xie2018], or without square brackets, in the text, as @Xie2016.


The bibliography is processed by Pandoc when producing Word or HTML documents.
The bibliographic style can be specified, by adding the line 

    csl: file_name.csl
    
in the document header and copying the _.csl_ style file to the project folder.
More than a thousand styles are available[^5] and their URL can be used instead of copying the file, e.g.:

    csl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/xxx

[^5]: <https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles>

For PDF documents, the bibliography is managed by natbib.
The style is declared in the header:

    biblio-style: chicago

It can be changed as long as the appropriate `.bst` file (by default: `chicago.bst`) is included in the project. 


## Forcing line breaks

Hyphenation is handled automatically in LaTeX.
If a word is not hyphenated correctly, add its hyphenation in the preamble of the file with the command `hyphenation` (words are separated by spaces, hyphenation locations are represented by dashes).

If LaTeX can't find a solution for the line break, for example because some code is too long a non-breaking block, add the LaTeX command `\break` to the line break location.
Do not leave a space before the command. 
The HTML document ignores LaTeX commands.


## Languages

Languages are declared in the document header.

The main language of the document (`lang`) changes the name of some elements, such as the table of contents.
The change of language in the document (one of `otherlangs`) is managed in LaTeX (but not fully in HTML).

For a single word, to ensure correct hyphenation in LaTeX, use the following command, ignored un HTML: 

    \foreignlanguage{italian}{ciao}

For a paragraph, to also ensure correct quotes and punctuation spacing, use 

```
::: {lang=fr}
"Bonjour" en français!
:::
```

to obtain:

::: {lang=fr}
"Bonjour" en français!
:::

The current language has an effect only in LaTeX output: a space is added before double punctuation in French, the size of spaces is larger at the beginning of sentences in English, etc.

Language codes are used in the header, such as `en-US` but language names are necessary in LaTeX.
Name matches are listed in table 3 of the polyglossia package documentation[^7].
Note that this template uses the "babel" package rather than "polyglossia".
