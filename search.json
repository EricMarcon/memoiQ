The syntax is that of Markdown with some extensions.\nThe book is organized in chapters. Each chapter is an Rmd file, whose name normally begins with its number (e.g. 01-intro.Rmd). All Rmd files in the project folder are actually treated as chapters, sorted by filename. The index.Rmd file is special: it contains the document header and the first chapter.\nThis first chapter is placed in the foreword of the printed book: it should not be numbered (hence the {-} code next to the title) in the HTML version. It must end with the LaTeX command \\mainmatter which marks the beginning of the body of the book.\nThe outline levels start with # for chapters (only one per file), ## for sections, etc.\nCompilation in PDF format is done by XeLaTeX, which must be installed.\nWhile writing, it is strongly advised to create only the HTML file, which is much faster than a LaTeX compilation. Each chapter can be viewed very quickly by clicking on the Knit button above the source window. The entire book is created by clicking on the Build Book button in the RStudio Build window. The button’s drop-down list allows you to create all documents or limit yourself to one format.",

Under Windows, use MikTex. The automatic download of missing packages (under Windows: MiKTeX settings, Install missing packages=Yes) is required.\nThe main file is index.Rmd which contains the description of the book in its header. All other .Rmd files in the folder contain a chapter: the order of chapters is that of the file names, sorted alphabetically. The references.bib file contains the bibliography.\nThe basic parameters of the project must be entered in the following files.\nIn the file header, enter the title of the work and the name of the author(s).\nThe date field may be kept to display the knitting date automatically.\nThe url field contains the link to the GitHub pages of the project. It is used by build_readme().\nThe github-repo field contains the name of the repository of the project on GitHub. It is used to build a link to the repository from the menu bar of the GitBook version of the document.\ndescription is used by build_readme() and to build an HTML meta tag intended for search engines. cover-image is the name of an image file that will be used by social networks when the GitBook is shared. Twitter uses both to build a link to the project. If a PDF file is used as the PDF book cover (see below), a good idea is to export it to PNG and declare the PNG file in cover-image.\nThe cover will be:\nDelete one of the two instructions in the header or both covers will be built, like in the gallery1.\nThe languages are specified according to the IETF language tags, such as “en-US”. The main language (lang) is that of the structure of the document, translating elements such as “chapter”. The other languages (otherlangs) can be used to switch language inside the PDF document to benefit from correct hyphenation.\nThe name of the .bib file containing the references is in bibliography. It must be entered with its .bib extension.\nThe default citation style in HTML outputs is chicago-author-date.csl. Any valid csl file can be used: uncomment the line and enter the file name. Note that PDF outputs use their own style: see below.\nLaTeX specific options are:\nBibliography is managed by BibLaTeX, whose options should not be changed except for the style. It is verbose-inote in documents with large margins to show the full citations in them. The citations are called as notes in the text. authoryear-ibid is suited for small-margin documents: the citations in the text contain author and year, and no footnote is used. The line pageref=true must be deleted or commented out if this style is used or an error may occur during LaTeX compilation.\nlongbibliography formats the bibliography on two columns with a small font when it is set to true. If false, the regular font is used in a single column with small margins.\nThe back cover appears in PDF outputs only. It is designed to to display abstract and keyword in several languages if necessary. The items of backcover are a list:\nbackcoverfontsize may be changed better fit the page size, according to the length of the abstracts.\nSome options should not be modified, including:\nSome may be added to the header:\nFor a student thesis, prepare the cover page with Word, Powerpoint or a DTP program and save it in PDF format, in A4 size.

The bootstrap_options = \"striped\" option provides more readable tables in HTML.\nIn LaTeX, longtable = TRUE selects the “longtable” package to format tables. Such tables are placed in the text. Due to limits of the “longtable” package which does not support multi-column layouts, the Stylish Article template uses a workaround that does not allow really long tables to be split into several columns or pages. So, longtable = TRUE only means that the table will be one-column wide and located in the text if possible. If not, it will float.\nTo use the full width of the page, like Table 2.2, longtable is set to FALSE and table.envir = \"table\" is added in the arguments of kbl().\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Large table with maths, on two columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nTimber\nThinning\nFuelwood\n\\%AGB lost\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nT1\nDBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, commercial species, $\\approx$ 10 trees/ha\n\n\n$[12\\%-33\\%]$\n\n\nT2\nDBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, commercial species, $\\approx$ 10 trees/ha\nDBH $\\geq$ 40 cm, non-valuable species, $\\approx$ 30 trees/ha\n\n$[33\\%-56\\%]$\n\n\nT3\nDBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, commercial species, $\\approx$ 10 trees/ha\nDBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, non-valuable species, $\\approx$ 15 trees/ha\n40 cm $\\leq$ DBH $\\leq$ 50 cm, non-valuable species, $\\approx$ 15 trees/ha\n$[35\\%-56\\%]$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table contains mathematics: the escape = FALSE argument is necessary in kable(). This feature is not yet supported by Quarto in the HTML output.\nFinally, the full_width = TRUE argument in kable_styling() adjusts the width of the table to the available width. It must be set for correct formatting of two-column tables in LaTeX.\nNote that tables can’t be shown on the first page of the PDF output of the Stylish Article template: they would conflict with the table of contents.",
